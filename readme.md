PLANNR : https://plannr-productive-app.herokuapp.com/ 

1. Problem Statement
	- The purpose of this app is to provide users with an alternative to the standard approach that you get with todo-list apps
	- This app allows users to have a quick overview of all the tasks they have at hand, sorted by priorities (1-4)
	- My goal was to make a usable app within the given time that people would actually use in day-to-day activities

2. Technologies & Frameworks
	- Technologies: Node JS, Express, Postgres & SQL, Mini-React
	- Frameworks: MVC
	- Other: Heroku, Github, Slack, Sublime

3. Approach Taken
	- Idea generation: get inspiration and research top competitors in a field
	- Creating user stories: identify a persona/user that would actually need this app (eg: someone who wants to have an overview of all tasks as opposed to searching and starring for tasks in one long list)
	- Planning relationships and tables: creating a simple ERD with detailed columns in each table
	- Create wireframe: visualize each page that a user will see including key elements (call-to-actions) and which element a user interacts with
	- Writing the code using technologies written above
	- Testing code, revising with feedback and refactoring
	- Deploying project on Heroku

4. What I learnt
	- There are an endless amount of features to add. 
	- Know how to prioritize based on time and skill constraints.
	- Setting up a solid ERD before beginning will save time later.
	- Having a professional front-end is equally as important.

5. Installation instructions
	- install node, express and relevant packages
	- install heroku
